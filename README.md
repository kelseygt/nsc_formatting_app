# nsc_formatting_app

We perform regular uploads to the National Student Clearinghouse, which requires data to be formatted in a very precise manner. This Shiny webapp takes a raw data upload from a SQL pull out of the Banner student information system, and formats the data to match the required structure/format for subsequent upload.
